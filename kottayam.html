          <p class="card-text text-align">
            Located at a height of 6000 ft above the sea level in the Western Ghats of Kottayam, Kerala, Illikkal Kallu is a major tourist attraction and one of the most pristine spots in all of India. Situated in Moonnilavu Village, Meenachil taluk, the nearest city to the summit is Teekoy. Besides several other factors which make this peak unique, the most prominent feature is that half the boulder of the majestic rock has fallen apart. 
            <p class="card-text text-align">
                The remaining half stands sturdy and presents an extremely exalted picture. Surrounded by colossal green hills, the offbeat destination boasts of immaculate environs, enchanting panoramic vistas and an all around utopian atmosphere. In addition to the surreal natural beauty, the sublime view of the Arabian Sea in the near horizon as a thin blue stroke, is a sight beyond description.

          The caves that were used as a resting place for the royal family of Madurai.
          The bewitching surroundings of Kottathavalam hillocks.The best time to spend the vacation here is throughout the year except monsoons. Due to the heavy rainfall, the hillocks become muddy and we will not like dirtying our branded footwear. Thus, check the monsoon and choose any season you like. During our trip, do not miss to explore the caves where the royal family of Madurai rested. These caves today hold the intricately rock-carved sculptures that catch the sight.

        <p class="card-text text-align">
          Located at a distance of 5 kms east of Pala in Bharananganam, Kottayam, St. Mary’s Church holds the mortal remains of St. Alphonsa (1910- 1946). Born as Anna Muttathupadathu, St. Alphonsa was an Indian religious sister and educator. She was the first Indian woman to be canonised as a Saint by the Catholic Church and also the first canonised saint in Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, an Eastern Catholic Church in India. Her death anniversary falls on the 28th of July which is a highly revered day when the church is thronged by devotees in huge numbers to visit to pay homage to the saint and to seek her blessings.
        </p>

        <p class="card-text text-align">
          The museum adjacent to the chapel holds her belongings- her books, cot, umbrella etc. A copy of her sermon is also available which reads, “Alphonsa is among the few great souls who lived in India; who have achieved greatness in God’s sight”. Next to it is her room where she spent several years of her life. Across the chapel is the two storeyed building which was originally the Papal podium, is now surrounded by a stadium and well-maintained terraced garden. The complex also houses a souvenir shop which sells books, rosaries and pictures to take home.
