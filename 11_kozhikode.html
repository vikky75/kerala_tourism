          <p class="card-text text-align">
            Situated on the Malabar coast and endowed with natural beauty, Kozhikode beach should be a must in the itinerary of your visit to the city. This beach is renowned for the sunsets that tourists throng here to enjoy. Though the water is muddy and not suitable for swimming, still the stunning view of the Arabian Sea that the lighthouse offers more than compensates for the shortcoming.
            </p>

            <p class="card-text text-align">                
                Payannakal, Putiyappa, Elathur, Beypore, all these beaches are part of the long stretch of Kozhikode beach. This beach lies on the western side of the city and is easily accessible through the four roads in the city.

            Situated near the mouth of Chaliyar river, Beypore beach is a famous tourist destination. Our visit to Kozhikode remains incomplete without a day spent at Beypore beach. There is never a dearth of activities once you are at the beach.

            Srikanteshwara Temple
        </h5>
          <p class="card-text text-align">
            Take a break from daily life and pay a visit to the Srikanteshwara Temple in Kozhikode. On our visit to Kerala, we must add this temple to our list of places to see in Kozhikode.   More than a hundred years old, this temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is a must-visit pilgrimage of Hindus. Apart from Lord Shiva, we can worship Lord Ganapathy, the serpent Gods, and Lord Krishna.

          </p> 
            <p class="card-text text-align">
                There is a much widely circulated folklore regarding the temple and its construction by the Maharaja of Travancore. Moreover, the Shivaratri festival is celebrated in much gaiety and fervor here. Apart from that, the moment we arrive in the temple, we will be engulfed by its tranquil atmosphere and both devotees and visitors are welcome inside it. Further, take time to explore the beautiful architecture and some quiet moments near the pond.

Kadalundi Bird Sanctuary</h5>
        <p class="card-text text-align">
            Kadalundi Bird Sanctuary is the perfect tourist spot for bird watchers and nature lovers. Just 19 km away from Kozhikode, this bird sanctuary is home to nearly 100 species of native birds and over 60 species of migratory birds. This is situated among the clusters of small islands on river Kadalundi. This is the habitat of gulls, terns, herons, and other alien birds which are a major attraction of this sanctuary.
            </p>

            <p class="card-text text-align">           
Apart from the birds, the sanctuary is famous for its scenic beauty and holds a panoramic view of the river and the Arabian Sea. This sanctuary is also known for the various kinds of fishes, crabs, and mussels. Early morning hours are the best time to visit to watch the birds.

            Thusharagiri Fall</h5>
        <p class="card-text text-align">
            Enjoy the breathtaking beauty of Thusharagiri Fall whenwe pay a visit to Kozhikode.  Two streams originating from the Western Ghats meet at this point to create the Chalipuzzha River. The river further trifurcates to create three waterfalls and the free-falling water creates a mist, thus giving the name “Thusharagiri”.
        </p>

        <p class="card-text text-align">
            
This place has a lovely view all around and you get plenty of activities to indulge in. We can go for trekking, or enjoy rock-climbing. You can also take a break to visit the wildlife sanctuaries or sit on the banks of the river to enjoy the waterfalls. The lush green forest and cool water of the streams all around add to your enjoyment. A word of caution though, people with a faint heart should avoid the place because it is nature at its wildest best.  This is a place to awaken the nature lover and wildlife enthusiast in us.
